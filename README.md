# Instacart-Grocery-Basket-Analysis

## Project Summary 

Instacart is an online grocery platform. This repository contains an exploratory analysis of their sales data, with the objective of deriving insights to support a targeted marketing strategy.

The analysis addresses key questions from the sales and marketing teams — including identifying the busiest days and hours for orders, understanding customer spending patterns, and exploring product popularity by department.

It also examines customer segmentation, exploring behavioural differences by brand loyalty, region, age, and income. These insights enable Instacart to tailor their campaigns and engage a more diverse customer profile more effectively.

## Key Questions 
1. What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day (i.e., the times with the most orders)?
2. Are there particular times of the day when people spend the most money?
3. Are certain types of products more popular than others? Which departments have the highest frequency of product orders?
4. What’s the distribution among users in terms of brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
5. Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
6. Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
7. Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
8. What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? (e.g., age, income, types of goods, family status)
9. What differences can be found in the ordering habits of different customer profiles?
